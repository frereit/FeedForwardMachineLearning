# FeedForwardMachineLearning
A (slow) from-scratch implementation of a Feed Forward Neural Network with Backpropagation in C# / .NET

In this Code Base I implemented a Matrix Class, from which I implemented a FeedForwardLayer class which is used in FeedForwardNeuralNetwork to learn on a given set of traning and testing examples. I use Backpropagation, but I have not (yet?) implemented any Optimizers, so I am just using the basic gradient.
